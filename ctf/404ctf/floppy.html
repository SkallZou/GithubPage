                            The challenge gives us a file named "floppy.img". The goal of the challenge is to recover the files that have been deleted by mistake. <br>

                            <u>Mount the disk image:</u>
                            <div class="squarebox">losetup -f : To find the first unused device
                                <br>
                                losetup /dev/loop0 ./floopy.img <br>
                                mkdir ./mountpoint <br>
                                mount /dev/loop0 ./mountpoint
                            </div>
                            <u>List the element present in the mountpoint:</u>
                            <img src="img/floppy/mountpoint.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="400">
                            Simply by looking at the name, a file seems to be missing, we have IMG_0001.jpg, IMG_0002.jpg, IMG_0004.jpg and IMG_0005.jpg. <br>
                            Where is IMG_0003.jpg ? <br>
                            It is potentially the file that has been deleted by accident. <br>
                            <img src="img/floppy/hexdump_img3.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="600">
                            Looking at the hex dump, IMG_003 is found and some data of that file is still present, we also see the date of deletion “2022-05-07”. As long as the data have not been completely overwritten, we might have a chance to recover it. <br>
                            To recover a file, two methods are possible, use of testdisk or autopsy. Testdisk method will be shown in that write up. Autopsy has a graphical user interface, which makes it easier.<br>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Testdisk</h4>
                            By default, testdisk will attempt to identify the partition table type, usually we want to select a default partition type since testdisk tries to find the correct partition type. In our case, “None” has been chosen.
                            <img src="img/floppy/testdiskselectmedia.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="600">
                            <img src="img/floppy/testdiskselectpartition.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="600">
                            <img src="img/floppy/testdiskselectpartition2.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="600">
                            Once the partition has been chose, click on "list" to list directories and files on the disk.
                            <img src="img/floppy/testdisklistoption.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="600">
                            <img src="img/floppy/testdisklistfile.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="600">
                            The color red indicates the deleted files or deleted folder. Press ‘a’ to select all the file and ‘c’ to copy. Choose your destination folder and press ‘c’ to copy. <br>
                            Once done, you should find the file that has been copied to your destination.
                            <img src="img/floppy/ls.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="600">
                            Open the file IMG_0003.jpg and the file is there.
                            <div class="squarebox"> Umount /dev/loop0 : Unmount the device <br>
                            losetup -d /dev/loop0 : Disconnect the device from the system</div>
                            And the flag is present in that file.
                            <img src="img/floppy/flag.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="600">
