                        <p>It is common to face some slowness when fetching many data from a big database. This slowness might be caused by many factors such as backend overhead or saturated network. Nowadays, computers are all multithreaded and multiprocessed so they can perform many tasks at the same time. It is also getting more powerful, with more ram and more CPU cores than before. Most of our usage does not fully use the power of our computer, so we can use it when we really need it.</p>

                        <p>Wireshark is one of the most used network protocol analyzer. Network engineers, cyber security engineers and any person who want to deep dive into network analysis might use Wireshark. Wireshark runs on many platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS) and uses pcap to capture packets, therefore it can only capture packets that pcap supports. In this tutorial, I'll give you the fundamental points that might help you to start analyzing packets with Wireshark. </p>

                        <p>A QR code (Quick Response code) is a well common type of barcode used to contain data. Nowaways it becomes popular to send data to a person throught QRcode, it can be used by a restaurant to display the menu, it has been done many times during the pandemic period in 2020. Almost any smartphone in 2021 can scan the QR code to read and analyze the data behind that bar code. How come the smartphone managed to analyze it so quickly and in less than 5 seconds gives you the message behind that code ? How does it exactly work ? <br> This article will explain the core functionning of a QR code. </p>

                        <p>Setting up a lab has many advantages and benefits when it comes to do some researches and testing. Being able to virtualize any machine is a big opportunity, you can create many systems without spending a lot of money. You can monitor and control your infrastructure as if you were in a small company. Testing things and doing researches are always better to do it in a development environment than in production. Therefore as a cybersecurity engineer or software engineer or network engineer, it is always good to have a lab to do some testings.</p>
